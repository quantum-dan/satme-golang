{"name":"SATme","tagline":"The SATme education platform for test preparation and finding scholarships.","body":"# Welcome to SATme!\r\nSATme is a new platform designed to help students get into the college they want with the scholarships they need.  It's still in development right now, but you can try out what we've got so far [here](http://45.55.22.104:8080).\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n### For the student:\r\n1. Create an account and log in.\r\n2. Take one of our practice SAT or ACT tests.  This will predict a score on the real thing and store it for you.\r\n3. Head over to the Scholarships page.  You'll be asked for some demographic data (optional, and we won't share it with anyone else), and then we'll match you with any scholarships you're eligible for.  They will be marked as \"Eligible\" or \"Highly Eligible\", depending on how closely your data matches their criteria.  You will also be informed of scholarships which are just beyond your current scores, so you know what you'll get if you improve.\r\n4. Head over to the Test Prep section and we can give you tips on how to improve your score.  We'll point out your weakest areas and give you specific pointers, as well as general advice like how to keep calm for the test.\r\n\r\n### For the school:\r\n1. Create a school account and invite your students to create accounts with your school.\r\n2. As your students use our service, you can view their progress.\r\n3. We'll help you identify the students who need the most help so you can focus your efforts where they'll be most useful.\r\n\r\n## Hey, geeks!\r\nSo, you're a budding computer geek, eh?  Well, it just so happens that you can study the inner workings of SATme if you'd like.  The source code is available at [our GitHub page](https://github.com/quantum-dan/satme).  It has an open-source license, so you can even base your own projects on it (as long as they're open-source too).  You can see a description of the details on our [Geek Page](http://45.55.22.104:8080/static/geek.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
